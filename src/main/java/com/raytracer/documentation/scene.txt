the scene contains the array of objects in our case it is the spheres.

one of the important function here is the get get_ray_color(Ray ray, int depth)

the ray is the ray for the particular pixel and the depth is the number of times the ray bounced off the surface.

we in this take that ray and find the point of intersection with each object int the scene
if it intersects .. good then we take the minimum distance because obviously the camera would
see the nearer object and the further objects are hidden behind so, therefore we
need the nearer object intersection point with the ray

after we have got it now we would bounce it off in a random direction for now as diffuse is the only material implemented with initial values Color(1,1,1)
