ray -- >

r(t) = o + t(d)

r is the position at any arbitrary time t
o is the origin loc where the ray started
d is the normalised(unit) vector // works for providing the direction
t is the scalar for moving along the vector


sphere -- >

(p-c).(p-c) = r^2

p is the point(--) on the sphere
c is the center of the sphere
r is the radius of the sphere


intersection -- >


if the ray intersected or not with the sphere we can get this by solving for t as t being the scalar moving the ray it would provide some observable results

substitute r(t) at p and solve for t (yes i mean solve it on paper actually ...)(while solving we get a term = o-c think it this way this is visually the dist bw origin of the ray and the centre of the sphere- lets name it l)
now l = o-c

we get a quadratic term >

t^2 + 2(l.d)t + (l.l - r^2) = 0

a = 1
b = 2(l.d)
c = l.l - r^2

solve for t using that formula for finding roots ->> that -b * root d so on .. yes that one only

t = -(l.d)+-sqrt((l.d)^2 - 4(l.l - r^2))

discriminant say D = (l.d)^2 - 4(l.l - r^2)

d == 0 : the ray cuts it at exactly one point -- we got a tagent at that point

d > 0 : the ray cuts the sphere at two points it entered and exited

d< 0 : the ray never intersected the sphere.
